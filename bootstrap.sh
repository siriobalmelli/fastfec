# This file (re-)sets up the Meson build system and makes the relevant build directories.
# Run this only once. Afterwards, just go into the relevant build directory and issue

# NOTE: This file is very specifically for the author's convenience;
# This library will probably build just fine on your system,
#+	even if not supported in this script;
#+	it will just require that you replicate these steps manually.
